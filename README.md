# VHDL_Codes
## Verilog Codes for Digital Circuits simulated on EDA Playground
- This Repository contains the VHDL codes for Basic Digital Circuits.
- These codes are simulated on the online free simulator  [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)
- Every Simulation needs two codes
    1. Testbench Code : testbench.sv
    2. Design Code    : design.sv

- Both codes are provided in a single file 
------------------------

## Steps to run simulation
1. Open EDA playground and login [Click Here to Open](https://www.edaplayground.com/)
2. Copy Testbench Code to **testbench.sv**
3. Copy Design Code to **design.sv**
4. Under **Tools & Simulators** select **Aldec Riviera Pro 2020.04**
5. To see the output graph select **Open EPWave after run** option .
6. Click on Run to run the simulation
7. Select the required Signals to plot.
